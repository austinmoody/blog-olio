One of my {% post_link 2016-Goals goals for 2016 %} was to write a letter to the editor.  Today I wrote my first Letter to the Editor ever.  It was in response to a letter that our local paper published recently titled "[Americans for Prosperity and free speech](http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Letter-to-the-Editor/2016/01/29/Americans-for-Prosperity.html?ci=stream&lp=5&p=1)".

This is what I submitted:

> It was interesting to read the recent letter published touting the wonders of Americans for Prosperity by Andrew Ogle.  What is even more interesting is to consider what Mr. Ogle left out.

> AFP is nothing more than a mouthpiece for Koch Industries. Built by Fred Koch and now run by his sons Charles and David. The fortune of Fred Koch that now backs AFP was not built on the backs of freedom.  The Koch fortune is one created in part by the creation of oil refineries for two of the worst people of the 2oth Century: Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler.  In fact, Fred Koch was even known to be quite smitten with the fascism of Nazi Germany.

> Mr. Ogle also fails to mention that the AFP also supported the TARP bailout at the behest of the Koch Brothers.  Funny how staring down a crashing economy, worried about your precious fortune, can send you running to the Government you hate.  What type of organization touts their love of a free market, a market completely free of Government interference?  And yet is happy to have the Government step in and rescue them?

> Americans for Prosperity is not an organization that cares about your freedom or my freedom.  Americans for Prosperity only cares to build an America where Charles and David Koch own every politician and election from sea to shining sea.

Now we'll wait and see if they actually print it!
