![Blackstar by David Bowie](/i/blackstar-david-bowie.jpg)

This past Friday (08-Jan-2015), David Bowie released a new album that has completely blown me away.  I'm not a Bowie fanatic.  I know his songs that were mainstays on classic rock radio when I was growing up.  But beyond that I've never really dug too deep.

But this new album is just amazing, and makes me want to go back and dig in deeper to his catalog.  

This new album is dark.  It is strange.  Jazz saxophonist [Donny McCaslin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_McCaslin) features heavily on it.  The drummer, [Mark Guiliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guiliana), is shit hot.  The whole thing is fantastic.  

Even the video for the song Blackstar is great, check it out:
