The only book of the bunch that I truly regret is _The Road to Character_.  I was lured in by the historical and biographical elements (which were good) but in the end felt like I was being preached to by David Brooks.  The same David Books that generally causes quite a bit of eye rolling in me with his New York Times editorials.

Unfortunately I was left a bit cold by the memoirs by Kim Gordon and Carrie Brownstein.  I was really looking forward to both of these this year but was left with a bit of a _'meh'_ feeling.

I've loved every story I've ever read by Ottessa Moshfegh and her novel _Eileen_ is no exception.

Jami Attenberg's last novel, _The Middlesteins_, was my favorite book the year that it was released.  I didn't like _Saint Mazie_ as much but it was still great.  And I'd recommend Attenberg to anyone who hasn't read her yet.

Obviously I fell pretty hard down the Knausgaard hole this year, but sorry not sorry.  Those books are fascinating.
